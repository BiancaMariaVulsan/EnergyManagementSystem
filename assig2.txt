the device simulator - multiple instanes of this (for each device) read at each 10 min the measurements and place 
the measurements inside a queue
the monitoring and communication ms - consumer
- once it has a message from the queue, it consumes it
- check whether the hourly consumption exceeds the threshold def for each device in assig 1
- if exceede, notify the device by means of WEB SOCKETS (assure bidir communication)

Rabbit MQ for the indirect communication between services

the message sent from the device simulator should have json format {id of the device, timestamp, energy value}

for 10 define multiple instances of the device simulator (that's why we need the id in the message)

the device simulator should not be executed in a docker container!!!

publich subscribe
- when we have multiple consumers that need to receive the message


see the support presentation
the measurements are in an excef file (link in the assignment)
teams files presentation

in monitoring and communication db am nevoie de:
- un tabel unde stochez datele de la senzori asa cum vin
- un tabel in care stochez datele procesate

- pr device simulator: ori facem jaruri diferite in functie de un fisier de configurare care contine device_id-ul
- sau dam parametrii la configurarea din InteliJ
- device simulator-ul il creeam manual


dockerfile:
